        "question": "What is CBD?",
        "answer": "<p>CBD, or cannabidiol, is a plant part taken from Cannabis sativa and acts on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) to help balance the body and improve your overall mood and well-being.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Does CBD impact our feelings?",
        "answer": "<p>While research continues to explore its effects on physical and mental health, many people globally are using CBD to positively impact sleep, hormones, learning, memory, immune responses, pain and inflammation, metabolism, and more.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of CBD products are available?",
        "answer": "<p>CBD products are available in various forms to cater to different needs:</p><p>· Oils and Tinctures: Versatile liquids for direct intake or added to food and drinks for customizable dosing;</p><p>· Capsules: Convenient, pre-measured doses for easy daily use;</p><p>· Topicals: Creams and balms for targeted relief, perfect for skin care;</p><p>· Vaping Products: Fast-acting inhalation options with necessary accessories;</p><p>· CBD Flowers and Hash: Raw forms for personal use or unique gifts;</p><p>· Pet Products: CBD oils and treats formulated for pets’ health and well-being.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are CBD products legal?",
        "answer": "<p>Within the European single market, CBD derived from industrial hemp with minimal THC level is legal. However, the rules can differ between member states, and some countries impose bigger restrictions.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are HHC produjcts legal?",
        "answer": "<p>While HHC is mostly banned in European countries, consumers may explore alternative cannabinoids like CBD or CBG, which are more widely accepted.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What’s the difference between CBD and THC?",
        "answer": "<p>The key and biggest difference is how it affects the mind. CBD is not psychoactive (it doesn't change thinking or awareness) and is much appreciated for its anti-inflammation, brain protection, and calming qualities. Meanwhile, THC is known for its mind-altering effects and brings about the typical joy linked to cannabis.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What’s the difference between CBD and CBG?",
        "answer": "<p>Cannabis plants make CBG at the start of their growth, which changes into substances like CBD. CBD is common, cheap, and often used for anxiety or pain. CBG is less common and more pricey. It connects right ͏͏ to “the cannabinoid spot”, helping the brain and digestive system. Both are not mind-altering and match each other’s effects.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "For how long CBD flowers can last?",
        "answer": "<p>When stored correctly, CBD flowers can last over a year. Use airtight glass jars, keep them in a dark, cool place (between 5º and 19º), and maintain humidity levels of 55% to 62% with a humidity pack to prevent mold or dryness. Refrigerators are not ideal because of their higher humidity levels.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can CBD flowers be smoked?",
        "answer": "<p>Although laws in many countries, including the European Union, make smoking CBD flowers illegal, they are often used as souvenirs or for creating homemade products like DIY tinctures, oils, and baked goods.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "How does CBD work?",
        "answer": "<p>CBD interacts with multiple receptor systems like serotonin and dopamine pathways, including the ECS, but does not bind directly as THC does. It positively impacts our body and brain without intoxicating effects in key areas like mood balance, pain, immune responses, quality of sleep, and much more.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I buy CBD flowers?",
        "answer": "<p>CBD flowers can be conveniently purchased from many online stores, including ours. You only need to pick some high-quality flowers from our catalog while we concentrate on delivering top-tier products.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the correct way to take CBD oil?",
        "answer": "<p>We recommend using it sublingually for faster and better absorption. Start with small dosages (5-10 mg or 1-2 drops) at the beginning, gradually increasing it by 5 mg (1 drop) to the point when it works for you.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is CBD dangerous?",
        "answer": "CBD itself is not dangerous or harmful when responsibility is taken. It’s good to be sure you buy only high-quality products, as some may contain contaminants. Always ask your doctor for advice if you are unsure or taking other medications.</p>"
