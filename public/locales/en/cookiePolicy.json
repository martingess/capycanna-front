It also explains  how you can control their use.</p><p>  <strong>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE PLACING YOUR ORDER.</strong></p><p>  If you have any questions, you can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@risemee.com\">support@risemee.com</a>.</p><ol>  <li class=\"none-list-title\">    <h2>1. COOKIES</h2>    <ol>      <li>        A cookie is a small text file that is placed onto your device (e.g. computer,        smartphone, or other electronic device) when you visit our website to store a        range of information, for example, your language preference or the browser and        device you are using to view the website. These cookies are set by us and are        called first-party cookies. We may also use third-party cookies, which are        cookies from a domain different from the domain of our website, for our        advertising and marketing efforts.      </li>      <li>        Session cookies expire each time you close your browser and do not remain on        your device afterward. These cookies allow our website to link your actions        during a particular browser session.      </li>      <li>        Persistent cookies will remain on your device for a period of time and will        expire on a set expiration date, or when you delete them manually from your        cache. These cookies are stored on your device between browser sessions and        allow your preferences and actions across our website to be remembered.      </li>    </ol>  </li>  <li class=\"none-list-title\">    <h2>2. SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h2>    <ol>      <li>        In addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies that may be used on        the web or in mobile ecosystems.      </li>      <ol>        <li>          Web beacons are small, transparent images (also known as          \"pixel tags\", \"web bugs\", or \"GIFs\") that contain a unique identifier.          They are embedded into a website or an email. When your browser reads the code          of the website, it communicates with our server to display the image, and          through this process, we acquire information such as technical specifications          of your device, operating systems, and settings being used. It can also track          your activities during a session. Additionally, it enables us to recognize          when each email was opened, from what IP address, and from what device. We use          this information to improve our email communication.        </li>        <li>          Software development kits (SDK) are third-party software          development kits that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help          us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect          certain information about the device and network you use to access the          application.        </li>        <li>          Local shared objects, commonly called \"Flash cookies\", are pieces of data          that websites using Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer to facilitate          Flash functionality. We may use Adobe Flash to display graphics, interactive          animations, and other enhanced functionality. Local shared objects can track          similar parameters to cookies, but they can also provide information on your          use of the specific feature that the cookie is enabling. For example, if it          facilitates the display of a video, we can receive details of how much of the          video was watched and when viewing stopped. Flash cookie management tools can          be accessed directly via <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com\">www.adobe.com</a>.        </li>        <li>          HTML5 local storage. HTML 5 is the fifth version of the HTML language and          contains functionality that allows information to be stored locally within the          browser’s data files. HTML5 local storage operates in a similar way to cookies          but differs in that it can hold greater amounts of information and does not          rely on an exchange of data with the website’s server.        </li>        <li>          Fingerprinting is a technique that involves combining a set of information          elements in order to uniquely identify a particular device. These information          elements include, for example: data from configuration of the device, CSS          information, JavaScript objects, installed fonts, installed plugins with the          browser, use of any APIs, HTTP header information, clock information.        </li>        <li>          Device Identifiers are identifiers comprised of numbers and letters, which are          unique to each specific device. These include Apple’s ID for Advertisers          (IDFA) and Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID). They are stored on the          device and are used to recognize you and your devices across different apps          and devices for marketing and advertising purposes. You can reset your device          identifier or opt out of personalized advertising in the settings of your          device.        </li>        <li>          Social widgets are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media          providers that allow you to interact with those social media services when you          view a web page or a mobile app screen. These social widgets may collect          browsing data, which may be received by the third party that provided the          widget, and are controlled by the third parties.        </li>      </ol>    </ol>  </li>  <li class=\"none-list-title\">    <h2>3.

WHAT TYPE OF COOKIES DO/MAY WE USE AND HOW?</h2>    <ol>      <li>        Necessary cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website        to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set        in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such        as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can        set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of        the site will not then work.      </li>      <li>        Functionality cookies.
