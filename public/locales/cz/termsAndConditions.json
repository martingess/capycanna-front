If You are a citizen or resident of another country, the law of the State of Delaware shall apply. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. </p> <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2> <p>Please read the following notice carefully, as it pertains to your legal rights.</p> <p> a) Resolution of Disputes through Arbitration. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you and Capycanna are bound to resolve all disputes and claims between you and us through arbitration. This includes but is not limited to: </p> <ul> <li>   Claims that arise from or are related to any aspect of the relationship between you   and Capycanna, regardless of whether they are based on contract, tort, statute, fraud,   misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; </li> <li>   Claims that arose prior to this agreement or any previous agreements between you and   us, including but not limited to claims relating to advertising or disclosures; </li> <li>Claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement.</li> </ul> <p> However, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court as long as the relief sought does not affect other customers, and the action is not removed or appealed de novo to a court of general jurisdiction. </p> <p> It is important to note that the following matters can only be decided by a court: </p> <ul> <li>   Matters related to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision; </li> <li>Whether a dispute can or must be brought to arbitration;</li> <li>   Whether the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) is unable or unwilling to   administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision; </li> <li>   Whether Section (b) has been violated or complied with for purposes of awarding   relief under that section that a court can award; </li> <li>Whether Sections (e), (f), or (g) have been violated or complied with.</li> </ul> <p> These Terms of Use establish a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration provision will remain in effect even after the termination of the agreement between you and Capycanna <strong>   By agreeing to arbitration, you and Capycanna both waive the right to sue in court,   have a trial by jury, and participate in class actions. </strong> b) To initiate the dispute-resolution process, the party seeking arbitration must first send a written Notice of Dispute to the other party by U.S. mail or professional courier service. The Notice should be sent to the designated Notice Address for Capycanna, and a copy of the Notice should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:support@capycanna.com\">support@capycanna.com</a>. The Notice must include the claimant's name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and Account name (if any), describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and set forth the specific relief sought. The Notice must be personally signed by either you (if you are the claimant) or by a Capycanna representative (if Capycanna is the claimant). </p> <p> To ensure the security of your Account and protect your privacy, you may be required to provide your authentication and consent for Capycanna to discuss your account or share your private information with anyone other than you, including an attorney. </p> <p> Upon receipt of a complete Notice, the other party has 60 days to investigate the claim. During this period, either party may request an Informal Settlement Conference to discuss a potential settlement. You and Capycanna must work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time for the Informal Settlement Conference, which can occur after the 60-day investigation period. Both you and a Capycanna representative must participate in the conference, unless otherwise agreed in writing. </p> <p> The Informal Resolution Period is the number of days between the date that the complete Notice (and Authentication and Consent, if required) is received by the other party and the later of (i) 60 days later or (ii) the date the Informal Settlement Conference is completed, if timely requested. Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled during the Informal Resolution Period. </p> <p> Arbitration proceedings cannot commence until after the Informal Resolution Period has ended. Section (f) has additional requirements for commencing certain coordinated arbitrations. All pre-arbitration dispute resolution requirements must be met to allow for meaningful dispute resolution. Failure to meet any aspect of these requirements may result in a court injunction against the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the AAA may not accept or administer such an arbitration, nor assess or demand fees in connection with one. If an arbitration is already pending and the requirements are not met, it must be dismissed. </p> <p> (c) Procedures for Arbitration: The arbitrator must abide by the terms outlined in this arbitration provision. The arbitration process will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with modifications made by this arbitration provision. The AAA Rules are available for viewing online at www.adr.org. The AAA will oversee the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA is not available or unwilling to oversee the arbitration in compliance with this arbitration provision, then an alternate arbitration provider agreed upon by the parties or selected by the court will administer the arbitration. </p> <p> Similar to court proceedings, both you and Capycanna acknowledge that any legal representative representing a party in arbitration must certify that they comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including the certification that the claim or relief sought is not frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator has the authority to impose any penalties available under the AAA Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or relevant federal or state law on all appropriate represented parties and counsel. </p> <p> Unless mutually agreed upon by both parties, all arbitration hearings must take place in the county (or parish) where you reside at the time the Demand is filed. If you file a claim for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be based solely on documents submitted to the arbitrator, a telephonic hearing, or an in-person hearing as outlined by the AAA Rules. If your claim is for more than $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. </p> <p> Arbitrators may take into consideration rulings from past arbitrations involving different Capycanna users. However, an arbitrator's ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different Capycanna users. </p> <p> Unless mutually agreed upon by both parties, all directly related claims must be brought forth in a single arbitration proceeding. If either party initiates a subsequent arbitration claiming issues that are directly related to ones that were brought up in a prior arbitration involving the same parties, then the AAA or the arbitrator must either consolidate the subsequent arbitration with the ongoing proceeding or dismiss any claims raised in the subsequent arbitration that would be prohibited by applicable law if filed in court. </p> <p> Regardless of the arbitration method, the arbitrator must provide a written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except for Section (e), the arbitrator can grant the same damages and relief that a court can provide under applicable law. Although under certain laws, Capycanna may be entitled to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if they prevail in arbitration, Capycanna agrees not to seek such an award unless you are represented by an attorney and the arbitrator has determined that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). </p> <p> (d) Arbitration Costs. Capycanna is responsible for paying all AAA fees associated with any arbitration that it initiates. In the case that you initiate an arbitration, Capycanna will pay some or all of the AAA fees, as long as you have complied with Section (b). If your claims are worth $1,000 or less for both parties, Capycanna will pay all AAA fees. If your claims are worth more than $1,000 but less than $10,000, Capycanna will pay all AAA fees above $20. Capycanna will pay its share of your filing fee directly to the AAA upon receiving a written request from you at the Notice Address, or if the AAA requires you to pay the filing fee, Capycanna will send that amount to the AAA and request that the AAA reimburse you. </p> <p> However, if the arbitrator determines that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as defined by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of AAA fees will be subject to the AAA Rules, and you will be responsible for reimbursing Capycanna for any fees it has paid on your behalf. </p> <p> (e) Individual Arbitration Requirement. You and Capycanna agree that any claims brought against each other will only be brought in your or its individual capacity and not as part of a class or representative action. The arbitrator cannot consolidate more than one person's claims or preside over any form of a class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding, unless you and Capycanna agree otherwise. The arbitrator can award any relief that a court could award, provided that the relief is individualized to the claimant and does not affect other Capycanna users. Neither party may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other Capycanna users. If a court decides that any aspect of this Section's limitations is unenforceable as to some aspect of the case, then all other aspects of the case must first be arbitrated. After completing arbitration, a court will decide the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case. </p> <p> (f) Coordinated Arbitration Administration: If 25 or more claimants with similar claims are represented by the same counsel, they must resolve their cases in staged proceedings. This process may delay the arbitration of your claim, but you must agree to it. In the first stage, claimants' counsel and Capycanna will each select up to 25 cases each to be resolved individually by different arbitrators. If feasible, arbitrators from the claimants' home states will be chosen. No other cases may proceed in arbitration during this time, and the AAA must not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases. The arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, with fairness to the parties. After the first stage is complete, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and Capycanna will pay the mediation fee. If the parties cannot agree on how to resolve any of the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing up to 50 cases to be resolved individually by different arbitrators, followed by mediation. </p> <p> If any cases remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved. However, there are four differences. First, up to 100 cases may be filed in the third and later stages. Second, the cases will be randomly selected. Third, arbitrators who decided cases in the first two stages may be appointed in later stages if different arbitrators are not available. Fourth, mediation is optional at the election of counsel for the claimants. Counsel will meet and confer between stages to improve efficiency and may negotiate with the AAA regarding the amount or timing of AAA fees. A court may enforce this section, including by enjoining mass filings, prosecution or administration of arbitrations, or assessment or collection of AAA fees. </p> <p> If this section applies to a Notice, the Informal Resolution Period for the claims and relief set forth in that Notice will be extended until that Notice is selected for a staged proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court may enforce this section and its requirements, which are intended to be severable from the rest of this arbitration provision. If a court decides that the staging process is not enforceable after all appeals have been exhausted, the cases may be filed in arbitration, and AAA fees will be assessed as arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed. </p> <p> (g) Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate: If Capycanna changes this arbitration provision (except for Notice Address, website links, or telephone numbers), you may reject the change by sending written notice via U.S. mail within 30 days of the first notice of the change. The rejection should include your name, address, phone number, account name, and a personally signed statement that you wish to reject the changes to the arbitration provision.
